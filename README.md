# README
This project is my personal blog made by using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
This blog was initially made to help me study data structures and algorithms while I searched for my first full-time software engineering job. It now serves as a place for me to post my findings and share my knowledge throughout my engineering career!
