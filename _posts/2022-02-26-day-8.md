## Introduction
We are continuing our recursion series with two more questions. Here is our question lineup for today.
1. Phone Number Mnemonics
2. Staircase Travel

## Phone Number Mnemonics
This problem is very similar to creating a powerset. The goal of the problem is to return every character string that can be returned from digits on a phone. Let's get into the solution.

The first thing that we want to do is create a hash with the corresponding letters for each digit.

```js
const LETTERS =  {
	0: ['0'],
	1: ['1'],
	2: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
	3: ['d', 'e', 'f'],
	4: ['g', 'h', 'i'],
	5: ['j', 'k', 'l'],
	6: ['m', 'n', 'o'],
	7: ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
	8: ['t', 'u', 'v'],
	9: ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z'],
};
```

To solve the problem, we want to create a recursive method that grabs all the letters to a corresponding digit. Then for each letter that the digit could be, we call that recursive method - adding that letter to the possible answer string.

```js
function helper(i, phoneNumber, current, results){
	if (i === phoneNumber.length) {
		const result = current.join('');
		results.push(result);
	} else {
		const digit = phoneNumber[i];
		const letters = LETTERS[digit];
		for (const letter of letters){
			current[i] = letter;
			helper(i + 1, phoneNumber, current, results);
		}
	}
}

```

Now that we have these two parts, let's see how to put them together in one solution.

```js
function phoneNumberMnemonics(phoneNumber) {
	const current = new Array(phoneNumber.length).fill('');
	const results = [];
	
	helper(0, phoneNumber, current, results);
  return results;
}

function helper(i, phoneNumber, current, results){
  //add the string to the possible results
	if (i === phoneNumber.length) {
		const result = current.join('');
		results.push(result);
	} else {
		const digit = phoneNumber[i];
		const letters = LETTERS[digit]; //get all letters for corresponding digit
		for (const letter of letters){  //recursively call method for all letters for the digit
			current[i] = letter;
			helper(i + 1, phoneNumber, current, results);
		}
	}
}

const LETTERS =  {
	0: ['0'],
	1: ['1'],
	2: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
	3: ['d', 'e', 'f'],
	4: ['g', 'h', 'i'],
	5: ['j', 'k', 'l'],
	6: ['m', 'n', 'o'],
	7: ['p', 'q', 'r', 's'],
	8: ['t', 'u', 'v'],
	9: ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z'],
};


```

## Staircase Travel
This problem gives us the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps we can take at a time. The goal is to find the total number of ways we can get to the top of the staircase. Now the recursive solution for this problem isn't actually the best answer. The best answer seems more like dynamic programming. 

```js
function staircaseTraversal(height, maxSteps) {
  let currentWays = 0;
  //fill with the number of ways to climb stairs of height 0. it will always be 1
	const numberOfWays = [1];
	
  
  //we are going to fill numberOfWays with the number of ways to climb stairs of height equal to each index
	for (let currentHeight = 1; currentHeight < height + 1; currentHeight++){
		const windowStart = currentHeight - maxSteps - 1;
		const windowEnd = currentHeight - 1;
    
		/**
    * This is almost a fib sequence, but since we can take more than 2 steps potentially
    * we aren't just doing n-1 + n-2 to get the answer
    * we need to subtract the number of ways to get to the top currentHeight - maxsteps - 1 step ago
    */
    
		if (windowStart >= 0) currentWays -= numberOfWays[windowStart];
		
    // now we can add current height - 1 steps ago
		currentWays += numberOfWays[windowEnd];
		numberOfWays.push(currentWays);	}
	
	return numberOfWays[height]
}

```
## Conclusion
Another day of recursion down! I think I'm getting it down a little more, but with the staircase problem, I've realized that I need to focus on dynamic programming next. Recursion and dynamic programming have some similar techniques that I do find difficult. Anyways, that's it for today. I'll see you tomorrow, cheers!
