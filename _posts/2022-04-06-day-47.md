Problem Statement: create a function that returns the length of the longest peak in an array. A peak is where the numbers in an array are strictly decreasing from a certain index.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `array` - an array of integers

Sample Input

```js
array = [1 , 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
```

Output

* An integer representing the length of the longest peak

Sample Output

```js
6
```

## Approach

We will loop through the array until `length - 1` to approach this problem. We will do this because at least three numbers define a peak. Then we will check if that current index can count as a peak. If so, we will expand left as far as possible as long as the numbers decrease. Then we will do the same with the right side of the peak. If we create a larger peak, we update the longest peak.

### Implementation

```js
function longestPeak(array) {
 let longest = 0;
 let i = 1;

 while(i < array.length - 1){
  //Check if the position counts as a peak
  const isPeak = array[i - 1] < array[i] && array[i + 1] < array[i];
  if(!isPeak){
   i++;
   continue;
  }
  
  //Expand as far left as possible if isPeak
  let left = i - 2;
  while(left >= 0 && array[left] < array[left + 1]){
   left--;
  }
  
  //Expand as far right as possible if isPeak
  let right = i + 2;
  while(right < array.length && array[right] < array[right - 1]){
   right++;
  }
  
  //Update longest peak if needed
  const currentLength = right - left - 1;
  longest = Math.max(longest, currentLength);
  i = right;
 }
 return longest;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) | O(1) - where n is the number of elements in the array
