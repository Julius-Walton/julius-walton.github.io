Today we will examine how to find a cycle in an unweighted, directed graph.

## Understanding the Problem

Problem Statement: Given an unweighted, directed graph, write a function that determines if the graph contains a cycle.

Inputs

* `edges` - an adjacency list of nodes

Sample Input

```js
  "edges": [
    [1, 3],
    [2, 3, 4],
    [0],
    [],
    [2, 5],
    []
  ]
```

Output

* Boolean valued determining if the graph contains a cycle

Sample Output

```js
true
```
