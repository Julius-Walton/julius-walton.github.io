Problem Statement: Create a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns an array of the sums of its branches from left to right.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `root` - the root of the Binary Tree

Sample Input

```markdown
 tree =    1
         /    \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
   / \    /   
  8    9 10

```

Output

* An array of integers representing the branch sums from left to right

Sample Output

```markdown
[15, 16, 18, 10, 11]
```

## Approach

We will use recursive methods to solve this problem. We will call the recursive function with the root node, current branch value, and our output array. We will add the node to our running sum from the recursive method. Then we will call the recursive method for the left and right subtrees of our current node. We will know when to add a sum to the output array when our current node's left and right nodes are null.

### Algorithm

Main Function

* Declare `sums` set to `[]`
* Call `helper(sums, root, 0)`
* Return `sums`

Helper

* Return if `!node`
* Set `current += node.value`
* Push `current` to `sums` if `!node.left && !node.right` and Return
* Call `helper` with `node.left`
* Call `helper` with `node.right`

### Implementation

```js
function branchSums(root) {
  const sums = [];
 helper(sums, root, 0);
 return sums;
}

function helper(sums, node, current){
 if(!node) return;
 
 current += node.value;
 if(!node.left && !node.right){
  sums.push(current);
  return;
 }
 
 helper(sums, node.left, current);
 helper(sums, node.right, current);
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree
