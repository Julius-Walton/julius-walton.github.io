title: "Day 27 - Review Day"

Another short post today. I've been feeling like I needed another review day. Particularly for the complex problems that I've solved during these 27 days. Also since I am done with one-quarter of the challenge I feel like I needed to boost in memory. So no problem for today. I'm planning on going back and looking at recursion and dynamic programming. They are still areas for confusion for me, but I think with more repetition and review I can learn the proper mindset needed to take on those problems. Anyways Cheers!
