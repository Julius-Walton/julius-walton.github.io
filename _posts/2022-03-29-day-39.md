Problem Statement: Write a function that takes a Binary Tree and inverts it - every left node is swapped with the pairing right node.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `tree` - the root of the Binary Tree

Sample Input

```markdown
 tree =    1
         /    \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
   / \   
  8    9 

```

Output

* The root of the inverted binary tree

Sample Input

```markdown
 tree =    1
         /    \
       3       2
     /   \    /  \
    7     6  5    4
                 /  \   
                9    8

```

## Approach

To solve this problem, we want to think about how the swap is working. If we look at the example, what happens is that at every height, the left and right swap places. Knowing this, we will use a recursive method to solve this problem. We will first swap the left and right nodes. Then from there, we call the method on both nodes and repeat until we reach null.

### Algorithm

* if `tree===null` return
* Swap the left and right nodes
* Call `invertBinaryTree(tree.left)`
* Call `invertBinaryTree(tree.right)`

### Implementation

```js
function invertBinaryTree(tree) {
  if(tree === null) return;
 swap(tree);
 invertBinaryTree(tree.left);
 invertBinaryTree(tree.right);
}

//Same as an array swap
function swap(tree){
 const left = tree.left;
 tree.left = tree.right;
 tree.right = left;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(d) - space where n is the number of nodes in the tree and d is the depth of the tree.
