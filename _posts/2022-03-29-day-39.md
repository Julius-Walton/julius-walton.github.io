Problem Statement: Write a function that takes a Binary Tree and inverts it - every left node is swapped with the pairing right node.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `tree` - the root of the Binary Tree

Sample Input

```markdown
 tree =    1
         /    \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
   / \   
  8    9 

```

Output

* The root of the inverted binary tree

Sample Input

```markdown
 tree =    1
         /    \
       3       2
     /   \    /  \
    7     6  5    4
                 /  \   
                9    8

```
