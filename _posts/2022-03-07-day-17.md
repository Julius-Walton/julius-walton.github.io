There is no new content for today. I've spent my time programming today by going over some of the questions that I have done. I've done about 50 - 60 problems so I decided that it was time for a much-needed review to see if I could solve the problems again. I might review again tomorrow or I may start on a side project. I'm not too sure yet. It seems like a good idea to take a break from the problem-solving grind for a few days though and work on something else. Cheers!
