## Introduction
I have another dynamic programming problem today. This is another problem that I studied in college. Whenever I come across these types of problems it's always a fun and nostalgic time.

The question for today
1. Longest Common Subsequence

## Longest Common Subsequence
Input: two strings - str1, str2
Output: array of strings

Problem Statement: Create a function that takes two strings and returns the longest common subsequence of those two strings.

One of the reasons that I like this problem is that the solution requires a matrix. Which reminds me of another dynamic programming problem I posted a few days ago - [Levenshtein Distance](https://julius-walton.github.io/2022-03-03-day-13/).

The basic plan for this problem is as follows
1. Create the matrix
2. Use the matrix to backtrack and return the LCS

Looking at the first step, why is the matrix important? Well, we are going to use the matrix to list the amount of common characters at a certain point. Here is an example of how the matrix will look like once it is fully created
