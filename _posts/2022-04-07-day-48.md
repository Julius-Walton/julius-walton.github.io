Problem Statement: Make a function that takes an array  of integers and return an array where each element is equal to the product of every other number in the array.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `array` - an array of integers

Sample Input

```js
array = [5, 1, 4, 2]
```

Output

* An array where each element is equal to the product of every other number in the array.

Sample Output

```js
[8, 40, 10, 20]
```

## Implementation

```js
function arrayOfProducts(array) {
  //Creating a new array for output
  //Need to fill it with one to avoid mult. by 0
  const products = new Array(array.length).fill(1);

  //Finding the product of every element to the left
  let left = 1;
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    products[i] = left;
    left *= array[i];
  }
 
  //Finding the product of every element to the right
  let right = 1;
  for(let i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
    //Need to multiply here to find the correct product
    products[i] *= right;
    right *= array[i];
  }
 
  return products;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
