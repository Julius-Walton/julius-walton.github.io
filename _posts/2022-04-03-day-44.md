Problem Statement: Design a function that takes two non-empty arrays and returns the pair of integers whose absolute difference is closest to zero. There must be one integer from each array.

## Understanding the Problem

Inputs

* `arrayOne` - an array of integers
* `arrayTwo` - an array of integers

Sample Input

```js
arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]
```

Output

* An array of two numbers depicting the smallest pair

Sample Output

```js
[28, 26]
```

## Approach

What we will do is sort both arrays. Then we will set pointers at the beginning of both arrays. If one number is smaller than the second number, we take the difference of the larger minus, the smaller number. Then we want to increase the pointer of the smaller number by one. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the arrays. If we find an equal pair, we can return that pair as 0 is the lowest an absolute difference can go.

### Implementation

```js
function smallestDifference(arrayOne, arrayTwo) {

 //Sort both arrays
 arrayOne.sort((a, b) => a - b);
 arrayTwo.sort((a, b) => a - b);

 //Set pointers for each array at beginning
 let indexOne = 0;
 let indexTwo = 0;

 //Keep track of the smallest difference, current difference
 //and the smallest pair
 let smallest = Infinity;
 let current = Infinity;
 let smallestPair = [];
 
 while(indexOne < arrayOne.length && indexTwo < arrayTwo.length){
  let first = arrayOne[indexOne];
  let second = arrayTwo[indexTwo];

  //Move indexOne if first number is smaller
  if(first < second){
   current = second - first;
   indexOne++;
  //Move indexTwo if second number is smaller
  } else if (second < first){
   current = first - second;
   indexTwo++;
  } else {
  //Return the pair if the difference is equal to 0
  //i.e. the numbers are equal to each other
   return [first, second];
  }
  //Update the smallest pair if current < smallest
  if (smallest > current){
   smallest = current;
   smallestPair  = [first, second];
  }
 }
 return smallestPair ;
}

```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(nlon(n)+ mlog(m)) time | O(1) space where n is the length of the first array and m is the length of the second array
