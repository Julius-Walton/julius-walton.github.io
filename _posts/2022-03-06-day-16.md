## Introduction
I made a lot of changes to my GitHub profile today. I created a new avatar and gave the whole profile a makeover. I think I was taking myself a bit too seriously with how to present my GitHub profile. I decided it would be best to be myself and add my personality to my page.

Anyways, the problem I have lined up for today is the Minimum Number of Jumps

## Minimum Number of Jumps
Input: array - a non-empty array of positive integers
Output: Integer

Problem Statement - Each number in the input array represents the number of steps you can take forward in the array. Write a function that determines the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index in the array.

Sample Input
```
 "array": [3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3]
 ```

 Sample Output
 ```
4
 ```

 This problem has two solutions. The one that uses dynamic programming is the least efficient of the two. I'm going to go over both since I studied both solutions.

 First is the dynamic programming solution. What we are going to do for this solution is pretty straight forward. We are going to store the minimum number of jumps it takes to get to a certain index in a different array. This is a technique that I'm realizing is very common in dynamic programming. Although it does increase the space complexity to O(n). Anyways, here's what we want to do.

 1. Create an array of input array.length and fill it with infinity
 2. Loop through all indices of the input array from 1 to array.length
 3. At each index we want to loop through all indices that came before our current index. 
 4. If our previous index + the number at array[previous index] >= i then we want to set the dynamic programming array of our current index to the minimum of dp[i], dp[j] + 1
 5. Return the last number in our dp array

Code
```js
//O(n^2) time | //O(n) space
function minNumberOfJumps(array) {
    //set array equal to infinity since we are trying to find
    //the minimum number of Jumps needed
    //this array will be used to store the minimum number of
    //jumps that it takes to reach that index in our input array
  const jumps = new Array(array.length).fill(Infinity);
    jumps[0] = 0;
    for(let i = 1; i < array.length; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < i; j++){
            //if array[j] + j >= i
            //then we know that our jump can at the
            //VERY LEAST reach i
            //therefore we want to find out the min between
            //the current number of jumps at jumps[i] and jumps[j] + 1
            if(array[j] + j >= i){
                jumps[i] = Math.min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1)
            }
        }
    }
    return jumps[jumps.length - 1];
}
```

Now for the second solution. The second solution was much harder to wrap my mind around. It runs in O(n) time and O(1) space. To accomplish that, the solution uses the maxReach that a number in the array can reach. While we loop through the array we take steps equal to our reach. Once the steps are at 0 then we know we have made a jump.

Here's the code for the second solution
```js
function minNumberOfJumps(array) {
    if(array.length === 1) return 0;
    let jumps = 0;
    let maxReach = array[0];
    let steps = array[0];
  for(let i = 1; i < array.length - 1; i++){
        //maxReach is keeping track of how far we can jump at a given index
        maxReach = Math.max(maxReach, array[i] + i);
        steps--;

        //once steps === 0 then we know we have exhausted a jump that we have came across.
        //now we get a new maxReach and take steps from there
        if(steps === 0){
            jumps++;
            steps = maxReach - i;
        }
    }
    //we need to add one more jump since we are only going to i < array.length - 1
    return jumps + 1;
}

```

## Conclusion
I'm enjoying this new format for blog posts. I think I will keep up with it for now. Another day of dynamic programming done and a few more days ahead. I want to get comfortable with this topic before I move on to anything else. Cheers!
