## Which came first? The blog or the first post?
The correct answer is the first post. Yeah, it's a bit backwards but I decided to make this blog after my first day of the challange because I wanted somewhere to document my journey - oops. That may be poor planning on my part, but we are here and we are going to keep going.

For this blog I used jekyll because I've used it before and honestly it's a super easy way to create websites like a blog in no time. As for hosting, I'm hoping on hosting this on GitHub with my free GitHub site. So if you're seeing this then I guess it worked!! Oh, before I forget, the theme I used is the minimal mistakes theme. I do enjoy my ✨ minimalism ✨ There's still much work that can be done with this blog, but I think this is a great starting point.

Anyways, I'll keep this update short as I don't have much else I did today. Looking forward to posting about Linked List tomorrow. Cheers!
