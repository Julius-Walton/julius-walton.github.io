For today's problem, we look at finding the youngest common ancestor between two nodes in a graph.

## Understanding the Problem

Problem Statement: Given the root of a tree, and two nodes within the tree

Inputs

* `topAncestor` - the root node of the tree
* `descendantOne` - a descendant of the topAncestor
* `descendantTwo` - a descendant of the topAncestor

Sample Inputs

```js
  "topAncestor": "A"
  "descendantOne": "E"
  "descendantTwo": "I"

  ```js
           A
         /   \
        B      C
       / \    / \
      D   E  F    G
     / \    
    H   I   
```

Output

* The node that is a common ancestor to both of the descendants

Sample Output

```js
node B
```

## Approach

To this problem what we want to do is find out which descendant is lower. By doing so we can then iterate through the tree from the lower descendant until we reach a node that is at the same level as the other descendant. Then if they are on the same level we can iterate upwards until both nodes are the same.

### Algorithm

* Find the depth of `descendantsOne`
* Find the depth of `descendantTwo`
* Raise the level of the lower node until both node depths are equal
* Backtrack through the ancestors of both nodes until the nodes are equal

### Implementation

```js
class AncestralTree {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.ancestor = null;
  }
}

function getYoungestCommonAncestor(topAncestor, descendantOne, descendantTwo) {
  const depthOne = getDepth(descendantOne, topAncestor);
 const depthTwo = getDepth(descendantTwo, topAncestor);
 if(depthOne > depthTwo){
  return getCommonAncestor(descendantOne, descendantTwo, depthOne - depthTwo);
 } else {
  return getCommonAncestor(descendantTwo, descendantOne, depthTwo - depthOne);
 }
}

function getDepth(descendant, ancestor){
 let depth = 0;
 while(descendant !== ancestor){
  depth++;
  descendant = descendant.ancestor;
 }
 return depth;
}

function getCommonAncestor(lower, higher, diff){
 while(diff > 0){
  lower = lower.ancestor;
  diff--;
 }
 while(lower !== higher){
  lower = lower.ancestor;
  higher = higher.ancestor;
 }
 return lower;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(d) time | O(1) space - where d is the depth of the tree
