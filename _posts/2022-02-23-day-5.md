## Introduction
Stacks are another data structure that I have struggled with for a long time. It isn't the implementation of stacks that I have difficulty understanding. It's learning their uses that confuse me. The next few days will consist of me learning more about stacks. Hopefully, I will be able to clear up my confusion quickly.

## Min Max Stack
As I've stated previously, implementing stacks isn't something that I find difficult. However, I came across the question of a min-max stack. This question was a bit of a challenge to me. 

The goal of a min-max stack is to give the minimum and maximum element in the stack at a given moment. The solution implemented this requirement in O(1) time. 

Another data structure is required to keep track of the min and max value while keeping the solution within the time requirements. This data structure is another stack/array list that contains key-value pairs of the min and max values. Essentially, as we pop and push values on the stack, we pop and push values from the min-max stack.

Let's take a look at the solution

```js
// Using an array based stack rather than linked list
class MinMaxStack{
    constructor(){
        this.minMaxStack = [];
        this.stack = []
    }

    peek(){
        return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
    }

    pop(){
        this.minMaxStack.pop();
        this.stack.popo();
    }

    /** Steps for push
    * create new key-value pair set min and max to input
    * if min max stack is not empty
    *   grab last element in min max stack
    *   compair new key value pair to last element and update values
    * push new key-value pair to both stack and min max stack
    */ 

    push(number){
        const newMinMax = {min: number, max: number};
        if(this.minMaxStack.length){
            const lastMinMax = this.minMaxStack[this.minMaxStack.length - 1];
            newMinMax.min = Math.min(lastMinMax.min, number);
            newMinMax.max = Math.max(lastMinMax.max, number);
        }
        this.minMaxStack.push(newMinMax);
        this.stack.push(number);
    }

    getMin() {
        return this.minMaxStack[this.minMaxStack.length - 1].min;
    }

    getMax() {
        return this.minMaxStack[this.minMaxStack.length - 1].max;
    }
}

```

## Balanced Brackets
This question helped me understand a basic pattern in using stacks. This question asks us to return true or false based on if the brackets in the input are balanced. Balanced means that all the brackets in the input are opened and closed. Also, all the brackets need to be closed in the order that they were opened.
Valid input

```
"(){}[]" // returns true
```
Invalid input
```
"({)}[]" // returns false

```

To solve this problem, we want to use a hashmap. The keys of the hashmap will be the open brackets; the values of the keys will be the closing brackets. This allows us to check if the element on top of the stack is a match. If the element on the top of the stack doesn't match we can return false.

Here are the steps to the algorithm

```
for every char in the string
	if char is open bracket
		push to stack
	else if char is a close bracket
		return false if stack length == 0
		if the top of the stack is the matching open bracket
			pop from stack
	else
		return false

return stack legnth == 0 ?
```

Now time to implement this in code

```js

function balancedBrackets(string){
    const stack = [];
    const open = '([{';
	const close = ')]}';
	const match = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'};

    for(const char of string){
        if(open.includes(char)){
            stack.push(char);
        } else if (close.includes(char)){
            if (stack.length === 0) return false;
            if (stack[stack.length - 1] === match[char]){
                stack.pop;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return stack.length === 0;
}

```

## Sorting a Stack
The last question I wanted to cover in this post today is sorting a stack. I remember from college that this was an algorithm that confused me. I think what is confusing about this algorithm is recursion. By using recursion in both of the functions needed for this algorithm, we can break the stack into single elements. From there, we can glue them all back together. To me, the code is more understandable than explaining it in words.

```js

function sort(stack){
    if (stack.length === 0) return stack;

    const top = stack.pop();

    // break the stack into single elements
    sortStack(stack);


    // paste the stack back together one by one
    insertInOrder(stack, top);

    return stack;
}

function insertInOrder(stack, value){
    if (stack.length === 0 || stack[stack.length - 1] <= value){
        stack.push(value);
        return;
    }

    //if the top is greater than our current value
    // pop the greater value from stack
    // rerun this method with our current value
    // put the popped element back on top

    const top = stack.pop();

    insertInOrder(stack, value);

    stack.push(top);
}

```

## Conslusion
That's it for today! Tomorrow I will also post more about stacks.I think in the upcoming days I will move on to recursion problems. Sorting a stack made me realize that recursion is a big weak spot in my programming knowledge. I am getting more comfortable with using stacks in problems and they aren't as tricky as I initially thought. The idea I need to keep in mind when using stacks is how I can fully utilize the pop and push methods to accomplish the task. Anyways, I can't wait for another day of programming. Cheers!!!
