An analysis of the Valid Starting City problem. The last question in the greedy algorithm series.

## Understanding the Problem

**Problem Statement:** The cities in this problem are in a circular path - i.e the array is circular. Each city also has a gas station that has fule to provide, and each city is a distance away from the next. Write a function that returns the index of the city in which we can start, travel through all the cities, and return to with 0 or more miles left. There will always be exactly one valid city.

* Inputs
  * `distances` - an array of integers representing how far away from city `i` is from the city `i + 1` in the array
  * `fuel` - an array of integers representing how much fuel is available at city `i`
  * `mpg` - an integer representing the miles per gallon that the car has

Sample Input
```
  "distances": [5, 25, 15, 10, 15],
  "fuel": [1, 2, 1, 0, 3],
  "mpg": 10
```

* Outputs
  * An integer representing the index of the valid starting city
