Problem Statement: Create a function that takes an array and returns a boolean representing if the array is monotonic.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `array` - an array of integers

Sample Input

```js
array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102]
```

Output

* A boolean value stating if the array is monotonic (from left to right the elements are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing)

Sample Output

```js
true
```

## Approach

We will use two variables to solve this problem: non-increasing and non-decreasing. They will initially be set to true. Then we will loop through the array. If the current number is greater than the last number in the array, we can set the non-increasing variable to false. If it is less than the previous number, we can set the non-decreasing variable to false. This will allow the algorithm to return if either value is true.

### Implementation

```js
function isMonotonic(array) {
  let isNonIncreasing = true;
 let isNonDecreasing = true;
 for(let i = 1; i < array.length; i++){
  if(array[i] < array[i - 1]) isNonDecreasing = false;
  if(array[i] > array[i - 1]) isNonIncreasing = false;
 }
 
 return isNonIncreasing || isNonDecreasing;
}

```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the array
