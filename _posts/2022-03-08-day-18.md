I've been a bit burned out on grinding coding problems, so I've decided to take a break and work on a project. For the project, I've decided to make a Netflix clone using basic React.  I won't be going into heavy detail here about what I have done. I will just be posting some screenshots with a list of what I've accomplished for the day.

## Progress

<p align="center">Progress for Day 18</p>

What has been done
* Created project
* Added base components for Nav, Billboard, Titles, and Footer
* Completed Header and Footer Section
* Acquired API Key from TMDB
* Added Project to be hosted on firebase

What to do
* Complete billboard using API to grab movie title
* Complete titles to show different movies

This project is going well. I'm very proud of how it is turning out. I'm not using anything too complicated here as I'm just trying to remember basic react. I love using react and I want to use it for more projects during this challenge. Hopefully tomorrow I'm able to create the billboard component and get the API to TMDB to work for that. I'm excited to keep developing this project. Cheers!
