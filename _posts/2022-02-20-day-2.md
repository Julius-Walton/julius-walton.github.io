## Which came first, the blog or the post?
The correct answer is the first post. It's a bit backward, but I decided to make this blog after my first day of the challenge because I wanted somewhere to document my journey - oops. That's poor planning on my part, but I'm moving forward and learning.

For this blog, I used Jekyll because I've used it before, and it's a super-easy way to create websites like a blog in no time. As for hosting, I'm hosing this on GitHub with my free GitHub site. Before I forget, the theme I used for the website is beautiful Jekyll. There's still much work to do for this blog, but I think this is a great starting point.

Anyways, I'll keep this update short as I don't have much else I did today. I'm looking forward to posting about Linked List tomorrow. Cheers!
