## Introduction
The post today is mostly going to be a video. Today I worked on the Netflix clone and I think I am finished for now. I'm super happy how it turned out and I might even do more website clones in the future. Here is the video showing a demo of the features of the project.

## Tech Stack
The stack that I used for the project consisted of React and CSS. I didn't use any CSS libraries or any other add ons except for the trailers. I used the official Youtube API to search for trailers and used react-youtube to display the trailers. I tried to keep everything in the stack as simple as possible. This way I could focus more on how React works.

## Conclusion
I'm pleased with how this project turned out. I think in the next day I will return to solving more coding problems, but this was a nice break from that cycle. As this challenge continues, I will try to include more side projects into my work. For now, cheers!
