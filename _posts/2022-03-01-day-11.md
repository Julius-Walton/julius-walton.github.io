## Introduction

Happy March!! Today is going to be the last day of recursion for now. This post is going to be particularly short as I'm only taking on one question. That question will be Non-Attacking Queens

## Non-Attacking Queens

Input: n - integer
output: integer

Problem Statement: Given number n, we want to return the number of valid queen placements of n queens on an n x n chessboard

Code

```js
function nonAttackingQueens(n) {

    //these three sets are going to be used  to keep track of the blocked positions
    //within our current board
    const blockedCol = new Set();
    const blockedUpDia = new Set();
    const blockedDownDia = new Set();
    return numberOfPlacements(0, blockedCol, blockedUpDia,  blockedDownDia, n);
}

function numberOfPlacements(row, blockedCol, blockedUpDia, blockedDownDia, boardSize){
    //base case
    if ( row === boardSize) return 1;
    
    let placements = 0;
    for(let col = 0; col < boardSize; col++){
        if(isNonAttacking(row, col, blockedCol, blockedUpDia, blockedDownDia)){
            //if the position we are testing on the board is non attacking
            //we are going to add the new blocked positions to the three sets
            blockedCol.add(col);
            blockedUpDia.add(row + col);
            blockedDownDia.add(row - col);
            
            //call the function again with the row incremented by 1
            //and add the result to our valid placements
            placements += numberOfPlacements(
                row + 1, 
                blockedCol, 
                blockedUpDia, 
                blockedDownDia, 
                boardSize
            );

            //backtracking sets to generate more positions on the board
            //removing the position that we just put down
            blockedCol.delete(col);
            blockedUpDia.delete(row + col);
            blockedDownDia.delete(row - col);
        }
    }
    
    return placements;
}

//checking if the space we are on is not under attack
function isNonAttacking(row, col, blockedCol, blockedUpDia, blockedDownDia){
    if (blockedCol.has(col)) return false;
    if (blockedUpDia.has(row + col)) return false;
    if (blockedDownDia.has(row - col)) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```

## Conclusion

That's it for today! I'm a fan of this problem. It was very challenging to figure out how this pieced together with a recursive method. As for tomorrow, I will start a new topic on dynamic programming. I feel like recursion will help me understand dynamic programming better and vice versa. Until then, cheers!
