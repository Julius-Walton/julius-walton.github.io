Taking a look at basic graph traversal with Depth-First Search

## Understanding the Problem
Problem Statement: Implement the `depthFirstSearch` method for the `Node` class.

Node Class
```js
class Node {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(name) {
    this.children.push(new Node(name));
    return this;
  }

  depthFirstSearch(array) {
    // Write your code here.
  }
}
```

Sample Input
```
            A
         /  |  \
        B   C    D
       / \      / \
      E   F    G   H
         / \    \
        I   J    K
```

Sample Output
```
['A', 'B', 'E', 'F', 'I', 'J', 'C', 'D', 'G', 'K', 'H']

```
## Approach
This problem deals with traversing every node in a graph. What we need to understand about DFS is that we want to go completely down a branch to print the results. What we want to do is from left to right go all the way down a branch, then go up until there is a right branch, and then start that process over again.

### Algorithm
* Push the name of the node to `array`
* For every `child` of the current node
  * Call `child.depthFirstSearch(array)`
* Return array

### Implementation
```js
class Node {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(name) {
    this.children.push(new Node(name));
    return this;
  }

  depthFirstSearch(array) {
    array.push(this.name);
		for(const child of this.children){
			child.depthFirstSearch(array);
		}
		return array;
  }
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity
O(v + e) time | O(v) space - where v is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges
