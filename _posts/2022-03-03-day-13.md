## Introduction
I've been feeling a bit unwell as of late, so I haven't been doing as much as I usually do. However, I still am doing one hour of coding each day. I'm trying my best to keep the streak going. Anyways, with that being said, I only have one question for today. That question is Levenshtein Distance. However, I will show two different solutions to this problem. 

## Levenshtein Distance
Input: two strings - str1, str2
Output: A single integer

Problem Statement: Create a function that takes the two input strings and returns the minimum number of edits needed to be made on the first string to create the second string. The edit operations are as follows: adding a character, deleting a character, and changing a character into another character.

Sample Input
```
str1 = "abc"
str2 = "zabx"
```

Sample Output
```
2 //insert z; change c into x
```

The way to approach this problem is to create a matrix. In this matrix, we want to place the minimum amount of edits for different parts of the string. We want to create this matrix by using this formula

So for the example strings "sitting" and "kitten" the full matrix would be the following

But how does this translate into code?

```js
//O(nm) time | O(nm) space
function levenshteinDistance(str1, str2){

    //in this section we are creating the boarder of our matrix
    //the matrix first row will be filled from 0 to str2.length
    //the matrix first col will be filled from 0 to str1.length
    const matrix = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < str2.length; i++){
        const row = [];
        for(let j = 0; j < str1.length; j++){
            row.push(j);
        }
        row[0] = i;
        matrix.push(row);
    }

    for(let i = 1; i < str2.length + 1; i++){
        for(let j = 1; j < str1.length + 1; j++){

            //if the last characters are the same
            //we can just continue and bring the same number over
            if(str2[i - 1] === str1[j - 1]){
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[i - 1][j - 1]
            } else {
                //if the characters are not the same then we want to bring over the
                //minimum amount of edits if we insert, remove, or change  a character
                matrix[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(matrix[i][j - 1], //insert a character
                                            matrix[i - 1][j], //remove a character
                                            matrix[i - 1][j - 1] //change a character
                                            );
            }
        }
    }
    return matrix[str2.length][str1.length];
}

```
This is the classic way I've seen this problem done. There are many other ways to approach this problem. This is how I was taught to solve this problem in school. However, there are some ways we can improve the space complexity of the problem. We can do this by creating two single dimension arrays. We only need 2 single arrays because at any given point in the problem we are only looking at 2 rows.

Here is how we implement that solution in to code
```js
function levenshteinDistance(str1, str2){

    //in this section we are going to find which one of our input strings are the smallest
    //from there we can create two row arrays with the small length of that string.
    //this will give us our space complexity of O(min(n, m))
    //our smaller string will act as the rows of our matrix
    //our bigger string will act as the column of our matrix
    const smallString = str1.length < str2.length ? str1 : str2;
    const bigString = str1.length >= str2.length ? str1 : str2;
    const evenRow = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < smallString.length + 1; i++){
        evenRow.push(i); //filling our first row with 0 to string length
    }
    const oddRow = new Array(smallString.length + 1);

    for(let i = 1; i < bigString.length + 1; i++){
        let currentRow = evenRow;
        let previousRow = oddRow;
        //switch rows i is not even
        if(i % 2 == 1){
            currentRow = oddRow;
            previousRow = evenRow;
        } 
        currentRow[0] = i; //filling in the first number
        for(let j = 1; j < smallString.length + 1; j++){

            //if the last characters are the same
            //we can just continue and bring the same number over
            if(bigString[i - 1] == smallString[j - 1]) {
                currentRow[j] = previousRow[j - 1];
            } else {
                //if the characters are not the same then we want to bring over the
                //minimum amount of edits if we insert, remove, or change  a character
                //currentRow is equal two our i index while
                //previousRow can be seen as i - 1 in the matrix
                currentRow[j] = 1 + Math.min(currentRow[j - 1], //insert a character
                                            previousRow[j], //remove a character
                                            previousRow[j - 1] //change a character
                                            )
            }
        }
    }
    return big.length % 2 === 0 ? evenRow[smallString.length] : oddRow[smallString.length];
}

```
The implementation for this solution is very similar. The only thing we have to keep in mind is switching between even and odd rows. Otherwise, the logic of finding the minimum edits is the same.

## Conclusion
This problem was very fun to work on. It reminded me of my advanced algorithms class in college. This question is a staple in dynamic programming, and I enjoyed studying the more efficient answer to this problem. In my research, I also found out ways to tackle this problem with recursion. There are many layers to peel back here. Anyways, that's all for today. Cheers!
