## Introduction

As the title suggest we are still on recursion. I think I will do one more day of recursion and then switch to a new topic.

Questions of the Day

1. Generating Valid Div Tag Pairs
2. Measuring with Ambiguous Range

## Generating Valid Div Tag Pairs

Input: numberOfTags - positive integer
Output: A List of Strings

Problem Statement: Return a list of all the valid strings that you can make with numberOfTags number of matched `<div></div>` tags

Code

```js
function generateDivTags(numberOfTags) {
  const matchedTags = [];

  //there needs to be an equal number of open
  //and closing tags. therefore, we can call
  //our recursive method with the number of tags
  //needed for opening and closing with the same number
  helper(numberOfTags, numberOfTags, '', matchedTags)
  return matchedTags;
}

//HOW THE RECURSIVE CALLS WORK FOR numberofTags = 2
//               (2, 2, ''. [])
//                    |
//             (1, 2, <div>, [])
//            /                 \
//    (0, 2, <div><div>, [] )   (1, 1, <div></div>, [])
//            |                          |
//    (0, 1, <div><div></div>, [] )   (0, 1, <div></div><div> [])
//            |                                                \
//(0,0,<div><div></div></div>, [<div><div></div></div>]) (0, 0, <div></div><div></div>, [<div></div><div></div>])

function helper(openings, closings, prefix, result){

  //we need to create our open tags first
  //because there needs to be an opening tag
  //before any closing tags are made in our string
 if (openings > 0){
    
    //add our tag to the string that we are creating
    //since we added an opening tag we substract the
    //amount of opening tags needed by 1
  const newPrefix = prefix + '<div>';
  helper(openings - 1, closings, newPrefix, result);
 }
 
  //we only want to add a closing tag if there is a
  //corresponding opening tag. therefore, only add
  //a closing tag if the number of opening tags
  //still needed in our solution is less than the
  //number of closing tags needed
 if (openings < closings){
  const newPrefix = prefix + '</div>';
  helper(openings, closings - 1, newPrefix, result);
 }
 

  //if closing tags equal 0 then we have finished making our string
 if (closings === 0) result.push(prefix);

}

```

## Measuring with Ambiguous Range

Input:

* measuringCups - an array containing arrays of a low and high number rang
* low - integer
* high - integer

Output: boolean value

Problem Statement: return if we can make a range within our low and high with the ranges given in the measuring cups

Code

```js
function ambiguousMeasurements(measuringCups, low, high) {
  //we are going to store our low high ranges in a cache
  //if they are within the range we can measure at 
  //a certain point we store true, else false
  const memoization = {};
 return helper(measuringCups, low, high, memoization);
}

function helper(measuringCups, low, high, memoization){
  //create our key to store our boolean value if we can measure
  //if it is in the cache we return the value at that point
 const memKey = low.toString() + ':' + high.toString();
 if (memKey in memoization) return memoization[memKey];
 
 if (low <= 0 && high <= 0) return false;
 
 let canMeasure = false;
  //for each cup in our measuring cups we are going to create
  //a high and low for the cup
  //if  the range is within the cups then we return true and break from the loop
  //else we want to find our new range for high and low 
  //then call the function again with our new measurements
 for (const cup of measuringCups){
  const [cupLow, cupHigh] = cup;
  if (low <= cupLow && cupHigh <= high){
   canMeasure = true;
   break;
  }
  
  const newLow = Math.max(0, low - cupLow);
  const newHigh = Math.max(0, high - cupHigh);
  canMeasure = helper(measuringCups, newLow, newHigh, memoization);
  if (canMeasure) break;
 }
 
 memoization[memKey] = canMeasure;
 return canMeasure;
}

```

## Conclusion

Today I feel like I'm starting to understand how the recursive stack falls into place. These problems were very tricky for me. I think one thing I need to remember is that I can use a cache to store values in methods. That sounds almost like dynamic programming again. Does recursion and dynamic programming go hand in hand? Anyways, cheers!
