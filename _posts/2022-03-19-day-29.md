Looking at removing islands from a matrix. A problem similar to finding rivers in a matrix.

## Understanding the Problem

Problem Statement: Given a matrix of `1`s and `0`s write a function to remove all islands in the matrix. An island is defined as a group of `1`s that are connected horizontally and vertically but not adjacently. Additionally, islands cannot touch the border of the matrix. Any group of `1`s connected horizonally and vertically that touch the border of the matrix are not considered islands.
