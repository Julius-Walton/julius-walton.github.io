## Introduction
Another day of recursion! I still need a lot more practice with it, so this process is going to take a while.

Here are the questions for today
1. Interwoven Strings
2. Sudoku Solver

## Interwoven Strings
Inputs: 3 strings (one, two, three)
Output: boolean
Objective: Return true or false if string three contains both string one and string two. String one and string two may be interwoven to make string three.

Example Input
```
one: thisisone
two: nowfortwo
three: nowthisforistonewo

```

Example Output
```
true
```

Code
```js
function interwoven(one, two, three) {
  //theres no way one and two can be interwoven if three
  //does not equal their lengths combined
  if (three.length !== one.length + two.length) return false;
  

  //this cache is a boolean array
  //we are going to store if both strings can be interwoven
  //at each index in this array
  let cache = new Array(one.length + 1)
    .fill(0).map(_ => new Array(two.length + 1).fill(null))
  return areInterwoven(one, two, three, 0, 0, cache);
}

//we are going to use i and j to act as pointers to iterate
//through one and two respectively
function areInterwoven(one, two, three, i, j, cache){
  //if the cache is already filled at this position we return
  if (cache[i][j] !== null) return cache[i][j];
  
  let k = i + j; // k is the position in the thirdString
  
  //if we reach i + j then we have fully interwoven the strings
  if (k === three.length) return true;
  
  //check if one[i] === three[k]
  //then we can recursively call the method for i + 1
  //this is iterating through string one
  if (i < one.length && one[i] === three[k]){
    cache[i][j] = areInterwoven(one, two, three, i + 1, j, cache);
    if (cache[i][j]) return true;
  }
  
  //check if two[j] === three[k]
  //recursively call for j + 1
  //return cache no matter what value
  if (j < two.length && two[j] === three[k]){
    cache[i][j] = areInterwoven(one, two, three, i, j + 1, cache);
    return cache[i][j];
  }

  //if we reach here then cache[i][j] is false because neither letter
  //is in k; therefore we just return false
  cache[i][j] = false;
  return false;
}
```

## Sudoku Solver
Input: a 9 x 9 array with some numbers filled out
Output: a valid solution to the sudoku board

```js
function sudoku(board) {
  solve(0, 0, board);
  return board;
}

//this function will serve as the way we are going to iterate
//through the board and call the other functions we need to find
//the correct digit that goes in each position
function solve(row, col, board){
  //iterating through positions in the board
  if (col == board[row].length){
    row++;
    col = 0;
    //if we make it all the way through return true
    if (row == board.length) return true;
  }
  
  //if the position on the board is wrong or empty we try digits
  if (board[row][col] === 0){
    return findDigit(row, col, board);
  }
  
  //call the function again with the next position in the board
  return solve(row, col + 1, board);
}

//this function will try each digit 1 - 9 against our validation meathod
//if we find a valid position we call our solve method with
//the new value in the board
function findDigit(row, col, board){
  for (let digit = 1; digit < 10; digit++){
    if (isValid(digit, row, col, board)){
      board[row][col] = digit;
      if (solve(row, col + 1, board)) return true;
    }
  }
  
  // backtracking if the algorithm has filled the board wrong
  board[row][col] = 0;
  return false;
}

//this function is going to be used to test if the digit
//that we tried for the position is in a valid place
function isValid(value, row, col, board){

  //testing row and column validation
  const validRow = !board[row].includes(value);
  const validCol = !board.map(r => r[col]).includes(value);
  
  if (!validRow || !validCol) return false;
  
  //testing the box validation
  //we are iterating through the smaller grid 
  //we divide by 3 since the board is 9 x 9
  const boxRow = Math.floor(row / 3) * 3;
  const boxCol = Math.floor(col / 3) * 3;
  //each box is 3 x 3 so 3 will be our upperbound for positions
  for (let r = 0; r < 3; r++){
    for (let c = 0; c < 3; c++){
      const rowCheck = boxRow + r;
      const colCheck = boxCol + c;

      //value for each digit in grid
      const existingValue = board[rowCheck][colCheck];
      
      if (existingValue === value) return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

## Conclusion
These problems were really fun to work on. The sudoku solver is one of my favorite problems that I have done. I feel like I'm starting to understand the mindset needed to approach recursion. More practice is needed, but I'm slowly getting there. Cheers!
