Continuing graph traversal with Breadth-First Search

## Understanding the Problem

Problem Statement: Implement the `breadthFirstSearch` method for the `Node` class.

Node Class

```js
class Node {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(name) {
    this.children.push(new Node(name));
    return this;
  }

  breadthFirstSearch(array) {
    // Write your code here.
  }
}
```

Sample Input

```js
            A
         /  |  \
        B   C    D
       / \      / \
      E   F    G   H
         / \    \
        I   J    K
```

Sample Output

```js
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K']
```

## Approach

This problem is another way of traversing the nodes in a graph. The way this graph traversal works is by visiting all the children of the parent node first then moving on to their children and so on. In this graph, it would be similar to traveling to each node in a layer before we go to the next layer.

### Algorighm

* Declare `queue` and add the current node to the queue
* While `queue.length > 0`
  * Declare `current` and set to `queue.shift()`
  * Push `current.name` to `array`
  * For every `child` of `current.children`
    * Push `child` to `queue`
* Return `array`

### Implementation

```js
class Node {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(name) {
    this.children.push(new Node(name));
    return this;
  }

  breadthFirstSearch(array) {
    const queue = [this];
    while (queue.length > 0){
        const current = queue.shift();
        array.push(current.name);
        for(const child of current.children){
            queue.push(child);
        }
    }
    return array;
  }
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(v + e) time | O(v) space - where v is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges
