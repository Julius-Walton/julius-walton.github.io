Problem Statement: Create a function that returns triplets of distinct numbers in an array that add up to a target value.

## Understanding the Problem

Inputs

* `array` - an array of integers
* `targetSum` - an integer representing the target value

Sample Inputs

```js
array = [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6]
targetSum = 0
```

Output

* A 2D array containing the triplets that add up to the target value

Sample Output

```js
[[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]
```

## Approach

We want to use three pointers to keep track of all three numbers in a triplet to solve this problem. We will set our first pointer at the beginning of the array. Our second pointer will be at the index right after our first pointer, and the third pointer will be at the end of the array. From there, we can move the second and third pointer towards each other, and when we find a match to the target sum, we add it to our output array.

### Algorithm

* Sory `array`
* Loop through `array` until `length - 2`
  * Set `left` pointer to `i+1`
  * Set `right` pointer to `length - 1`
  * While `left < right`
    * Find current sum
    * If `current` is equal to `targetSum`
      * Push triplet to output
      * Increase `left` Decrease `right`
    * If `current < target`
      * Increase `left`
    * If `current > target`
      * Decrease `right`

### Implementation

```js
function threeNumberSum(array, targetSum) {
  array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
 const triplets = [];
 for(let i = 0; i < array.length - 2; i++){
  let left = i + 1;
  let right = array.length - 1;
  while(left < right){
   const current = array[i] + array[left] + array[right];
   if(current === targetSum){
    triplets.push([array[i], array[left], array[right]]);
    left++;
    right--;
   } else if (current < targetSum){
    left++;
   } else if (current > targetSum){
    right--;
   }
  }
 }
 return triplets;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n^2) time | O(n) - where n is the length of the input array
