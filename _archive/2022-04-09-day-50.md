title: "Day 50 - Merge Overlapping Intervals"
tags: [Arrays, JavaScript]
---

Problem Statement: Make a function that takes an array of intervals and merges any overlapping intervals.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `intervals` - an array of non empty intervals

Sample Input

```js
intervals = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 7]. [6, 8], [9, 10]]
```

Output

* An array where intervals that overlap have been merged in no particular order.

Sample Output

```js
[[1, 2], [3, 8], [9, 10]]
```

## Implementation

```js
function mergeOverlappingIntervals(array) {
 //Sort the array based on the intervals first number
 const sorted = array.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
 
 //Create new array to store output
 const merged = [];

 //add first value to output array
 let current = sorted[0];
 merged.push(current);
 
 for(const interval of sorted){
  //Grab the current and next interval
  const[_, currentEnd] = current;
  const[nextStart, nextEnd] = interval;
  
  //Change merge the boundaries of the intervals if they overlap
  if(currentEnd >= nextStart){
   current[1] = Math.max(currentEnd, nextEnd);
  } else {
   current = interval;
   merged.push(current);
  }
 }
  return merged;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
