Today we will examine how to find a cycle in an unweighted, directed graph.

## Understanding the Problem

Problem Statement: Given an unweighted, directed graph, write a function that determines if the graph contains a cycle.

Inputs

* `edges` - an adjacency list of nodes

Sample Input

```js
  "edges": [
    [1, 3],
    [2, 3, 4],
    [0],
    [],
    [2, 5],
    []
  ]
```

Output

* Boolean valued determining if the graph contains a cycle

Sample Output

```js
true
```

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will use DFS. We will also use another data structure to hold a node's visited state values. During the DFS, we will mark every node we encounter as true. Since we are looking for cycles, we know there is a cycle if we meet a node more than once. If we complete the DFS without encountering a node that has already been marked as true, we know that there is not a cycle in the graph.

### Algorithm

* Declare `visited` - an array the same size as `edges` and set all values to `false`
* Declare `stack` - a stack the same size as `edges` and set all values to `fasle`
* Loop through every node in `edge` for each node
  * if `visited[node]` is `false` then DFS
    * If we encounter a visited node during DFS return true
  * else return `true`
* return `false`

### Implementation

```js
function cycleInGraph(edges) {
  const visited = new Array(edges.length).fill(false);
 const stack = new Array(edges.length).fill(false);
 
 for(let i = 0; i < edges.length; i++){
  if(visited[i]) continue;
  
  const isCycle = findCycle(i, edges, visited, stack);
  if(isCycle) return true;
 }
  return false;
}

function findCycle(node, edges, visited, stack){
 visited[node] = true;
 stack[node] = true;
 
 const neighbors = edges[node];
 for(const neighbor of neighbors){
  if(!visited[neighbor]){
   const isCycle = findCycle(neighbor, edges, visited, stack);
   if(isCycle) return true;
  } else if(stack[neighbor]){
   return true;
  }
 }
 
 stack[node] = false;
 return false;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(v + e) time | O(v) space = where v and e are the number of verticies and edges in the graph
