We are looking at removing islands from a matrix. This problem is similar to finding rivers in a matrix.

## Understanding the Problem

Problem Statement: Given a matrix of `1`s and `0`s, write a function to remove all islands in the matrix. An island is defined as a group of `1`s that connect horizontally and vertically but not adjacently. Additionally, islands cannot touch the border of the matrix. Any group of `1`s connected horizontally and vertically that touch the matrix border are not considered islands.

Inputs

* `matrix` - a 2D array consisting of only `1`s and `0`s

Sample Input

```js
matrix = 
[
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

Output

* A modified version of the input array where all of the islands are removed by changing the `1`s to `0`s

Sample Output

```js
[
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

## Approach

This problem is similar to the problem we covered in the post for [Day 26 - River Sizes](https://julius-walton.github.io/2022-03-16-day-26/). We need to find the appropriate neighbors of a group of `1`s like that problem. We also need to make sure those neighbors are only connected vertically and horizontally. We will also use another data structure to keep track of the nodes we have visited.

We want to find all the `1`s connecting to the border to approach this problem. We will use DFS on the matrix using a stack to accomplish this. When we see a `1` during the DFS, we will use a 2D array to store a boolean value. That value will state if that `1` connects to the border.

Once we have found all the `1`s connecting to the border, we can then loop through the inner part of the matrix. We will change every `1` to a `0` if that `1` is not in a position where we said it connected to a border.

### Algorithm

* Define `isConnectedToBorder` - a 2D array with the same dimensions as `matrix`. Set every value in `isConnectedToBorder` to `false`.
* Loop through `matrix` and for every position
  * If that position is on a border and has a value equal to `1`
    * Use DFS to find all neighboring `1`s
* Loop through the inner portion of `matrix` and for every position
  * If that position is not connected to a border and has a value of `1`
    * Set that value to `0`
* Return `matrix`

### Implementation

```js
function removeIslands(matrix) {
  const isConnectedToBorder = [];
 for(let row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++){
  isConnectedToBorder.push([]);
  for(let col = 0; col < matrix[0].length; col++){
   isConnectedToBorder[row].push(false);
  }
 }
 
 for(let row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++){
  for(let col = 0; col < matrix[row].length; col++){
   const isRowBorder = row === 0 || row === matrix.length - 1;
   const isColBorder = col === 0 || col === matrix[row].length -1;
   const isBorder = isRowBorder || isColBorder;
   if(!isBorder) continue;
   
   if(matrix[row][col] != 1) continue;
   
   findOnesOnBorder(matrix, row, col, isConnectedToBorder)
  }
 }
 
 for (let row = 1; row < matrix.length - 1; row++){
  for(let col = 1; col < matrix[row].length - 1; col++){
   if(isConnectedToBorder[row][col]) continue;
   
   matrix[row][col] = 0;
  }
 }
 
 console.log(matrix)
  return matrix;
}

function findOnesOnBorder(matrix, rowStart, colStart, isConnectedToBorder){
 const stack = [[rowStart, colStart]];
 
 while(stack.length){
  const current = stack.pop();
  const [currentRow, currentCol] = current;
  
  const visited = isConnectedToBorder[currentRow][currentCol];
  if(visited) continue;
  
  isConnectedToBorder[currentRow][currentCol] = true;
  
  const neighbors = getNeighbors(matrix, currentRow, currentCol);
  for(const neighbor of neighbors){
   const [row, col] = neighbor;
   
   if(matrix[row][col] != 1) continue;
   
   stack.push(neighbor);
  }
 }
}

function getNeighbors(matrix, row, col){
 const neighbors = [];
 
 if(row - 1 >= 0) neighbors.push([row - 1, col]);
 if(row + 1 < matrix.length) neighbors.push([row + 1, col]);
 if(col - 1 >= 0) neighbors.push([row, col - 1]);
 if(col + 1 < matrix[row].length) neighbors.push([row , col + 1]);
 
 return neighbors;

}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(wh) time | O(wh) space - where w and h are the width and height of the input matrix
