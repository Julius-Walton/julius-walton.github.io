Problem Statement: Write a function that returns true if the input binary tree is height-balanced and false otherwise

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `tree` - the root of a binary tree

Sample Input

```js
tree =     1
         /   \
       2      3
     /   \     \
    4     5     6
         / \   
        7   8

```

Output

* A boolean value representing if the input tree is height-balanced

Sample Output

```js
true
```

## Approach

A binary tree is said to be unbalanced if the difference in height between the left and right is more than 1. What we will do for this solution is recursively calculate the left and right subtree heights from each node. Once we find the heights of the left and right subtrees, we can determine if the subtree rooted at a particular node is balanced. We also know that if we ever run into a subtree that is not balanced, then the whole tree is not balanced. Likewise, if we make it through the entire tree without running into an unbalanced tree, then we know that the whole tree is balanced.

### Algorithm

Tree Info Class

* Set properties for `isBalanced` and `height.`

Main Function

* Return `isBalanced` of `helper(tree)` function call

Helper Function

* Return `TreeInfo(true, -1)` if `node === null`
* Set `left` to `helper(node.left)`
* Set `right` to `helper(node.right)`
* Set `isBalanced` to `left.isBalanced && right.isBalanced && ABS(left.height - right.height) <= 1`
* Set `height` to `MAX(left.height, right.height) + 1`
* Return `TreeInfo(isBalanced, height)`

### Implementation

```js
class TreeInfo {
 constructor(isBalanced, height){
  this.isBalanced = isBalanced;
  this.height = height;
 }
}
function heightBalancedBinaryTree(tree) {
  return helper(tree).isBalanced;
}

function helper(node) {
 if(node === null) return new TreeInfo(true, -1);
 
 const left = helper(node.left);
 const right = helper(node.right);
 
 const isBalanced = left.isBalanced && right.isBalanced && Math.abs(left.height - right.height) <= 1;
 const height = Math.max(left.height, right.height) + 1;
 return new TreeInfo(isBalanced, height);
}

```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the tree and h is the height of the tree
