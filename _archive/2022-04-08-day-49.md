Problem Statement: Given an array of integers between `1` and `n` where `n` is the length of the array, create a function that returns the first duplicate integer in the array.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `array` - an array of integers between `1` and `n` where `n` is the length of the array

Sample Input

```js
array = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]
```

Output

* The first duplicate number in the input array

Sample Output

```js
2
```

## Implementation

```js
function firstDuplicateValue(array) {
  //To solve this problem we will be setting a certain number
  //to negative in the array. when we encounter a negative number
  //then we know that we have encountered it before
  for(const num of array){
    const abs = Math.abs(num);

    //checking if we have encountered the number
    if(array[abs - 1] < 0) return abs;

    //setting the index at abs - 1 to a negative number
    //we use abs - 1 so we can set index 0 tto a negative number
    //if needed
    array[abs - 1] *= -1;
 }
  return -1;
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
