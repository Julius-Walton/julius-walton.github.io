Problem Statement: Write a function that moves all instances of an integer to the end of the array. Perform this in place.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `array` - an array of integers
* `toMove` - the integer to be moved at the end of the list

Sample Input

```js
array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
toMove = 2
```

Output

* The input array with the target integers moved to the end of the array.

Sample Output

```js
[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] 
```

## Approach

To solve this problem, we will create start and end pointers. Then while the pointers have not crossed each other, we will check if the pointer at the beginning is pointing to a value that is equal to `toMove`. If it is equal, then we swap the elements at each pointer. Then we will update the pointers accordingly.

### Implementation

```js
function moveElementToEnd(array, toMove) {
 //creating pointers at the begining and end of array
 let start = 0;
 let end = array.length - 1;
 while(start < end){
  //move end pointer to a position that doesn't equal toMove
  while(start < end && array[end] === toMove){
   end--;
  }

  //swap values at pointers if the start index is pointing
  //to a value equal to toMove
  if(array[start] === toMove){
   swap(start, end, array);
  }
  start++;
 }
 return array;
}

function swap(i, j, array){
 const temp = array[j];
 array[j] = array[i];
 array[i] = temp;
}

```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the array
