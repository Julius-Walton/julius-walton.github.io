Problem Statement: Write a function that takes a Binary Tree and returns the sum of the nodes' depths.

## Understanding the Problem

Input

* `root` - the root of the Binary Tree

Sample Input

```markdown
 tree =    1
         /    \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
   / \   
  8    9 

```

Output

* An integer representing the sum of the node depths

Sample Output

```markdown
16
```

## Approach

Like many binary tree solutions, we will sue recursion to help us solve this problem. What we want to do when calculating the depth is have a counter that keeps track of how deep we are in the tree. From there we add that counter to our total sum along with calling the recursive method for both subtrees. When we call both subtrees we want to increment the counter. Once the node we reach is equal to null, we want to return 0 since a null node does not exist.

### Algorithm

Main Function

* Call and Return value from `helper(root, 0)`

Helper Function

* Return `0` if `node === null`
* Return `depth + helper(left, depth + 1) + helper(right, depth + 1)`

### Implementation

```js
function nodeDepths(root) {
  return helper(root, 0);
}

function helper(node, depth){
 if(node === null) return 0;
 return depth + helper(node.left, depth+1) + helper(node.right, depth+1);
}

```

## Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree
