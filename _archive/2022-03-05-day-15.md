## Introduction

I have another dynamic programming problem today. This is another problem that I studied in college. Whenever I come across these types of problems it's always a fun and nostalgic time.

The question for today

1. Longest Common Subsequence

## Longest Common Subsequence

Input: two strings - str1, str2
Output: array of strings

Problem Statement: Create a function that takes two strings and returns the longest common subsequence of those two strings.

One of the reasons that I like this problem is that the solution requires a matrix. This reminds me of another dynamic programming problem I posted a few days ago - [Levenshtein Distance](https://juliuswalton.github.io/2022-03-03-day-13/).

The basic plan for this problem is as follows

1. Create the matrix
2. Use the matrix to backtrack and return the LCS

Looking at the first step, why is the matrix important? Well, we are going to use the matrix to list the number of common characters at a certain point. Here is an example of how the matrix will look like once it is fully created

To make the matrix, we need to use the following function

![](https://github.com/juliuswalton/juliuswalton.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/LCS%20Function.png?raw=true)

Now all that we need is to create a function to backtrack through the matrix to find the solution. If you look at the matrix above, the highlighted path shows the path we want to take to find the longest common subsequence of the two strings. To do this we want to loop backward while our i and j indices do not equal 0. We are going to check for each index if our current number in the matrix is equal to the number above or below it. If it is, then we want to shift our position to the position that has the same number as our current position. If it does not, then we know that the characters are the same and we want to add the character at the j-1 position of our string to the sequence. Then we move up the matrix diagonally to the left.

Here is how all of this translates into code.

```js
function longestCommonSubsequence(str1, str2){
    const lcs[];
    for (let i = 0; i < str2.length + 1; i++){
        //this is covering our first case in the matrix creation function
        lcs.push(new Array(str1.length + 1).fill(0));
    }
    for(let i = 1; i < str2.length + 1; i++){
        for(let j = 1; j < str1.length + 1; j++){
            //second case in our function
            if(str2[i - 1] === str1[j - 1]){
                lcs[i][j] = lcs[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                //third case in our function
                lcs[i][j] = Math.max(lcs[i - 1][j], lcs[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return buildLCS(lcs, str1);
}

function buildLCS(lcs, str){
    const sequence = [];
    let i = lcs.length - 1;
    let j = lcs[0].length - 1;
    while(i !== 0 && j !== 0){
        //if our current position is equal
        //to the right position, we travel right
        if(lcs[i][j] === lcs[i - 1][j]){
            i--;
        //if our current position is equal
        //to the up position, we travel up
        } else if(lcs[i][j] === lcs[i][j - 1]){
            j--;
        //otherwise we go diagonally and add
        //the correspoonding character from
        //the string to the start of the sequence
        } else {
            sequence.unshift(str[j - 1]);
            i--;
            j--;
        }
    }
    return sequence
}

```

## Conclusion

Another day of coding down. I'm really enjoying dynamic programming now. The problems were I can use a matrix make a log of sense to me. They make dynamic programming more clear because they show the solving of smaller subsets of problems in an easier way for me to understand. Cheers!
