## Introduction

It's day 14! That means I am officially two weeks into this challenge. Another week down and many more to go.

I'm trying to figure out a better format for my posts. I think it would be best to only focus on one or two problems every day. For those problems, I want to explain them very well. This not only helps me review, but it helps clarify the code that I'm posting.

Today's problem

1. Max Sum of an Increasing Subsequence

## Max Sum of an Increasing Subsequence

Input: array - integer array
Output: integer array of the following format [n, [a, b, c,...]]

Problem Statement: Create a function that takes a non-empty array of integers and returns the largest sum that can be made from an increasing subsequence of that array as well as an array of the numbers in said subsequence.

Sample Input

```js
array = [10, 70, 20, 30, 50, 11, 30]
```

Sample Output

```js
[110, [10, 20, 30, 50]]
```

Let's take a look at the approach to solving this problem. It's easier to think about this problem split into two parts. The first part is finding the greatest subsequence sum. The second part is keeping track of the sequence that returns the greatest sum.

To solve the first part of this problem we want to create an array that is an exact copy of our input array. We do this because we are going to store the max increasing subsequence for each number at each index. From there, we want to loop through our input array. At each index, in our loop, we want to compare our current number with every number that comes before it in the array. If the previous number is less than our current number then we know that we have an increasing subsequence. If we have an increasing subsequence we can then check if by adding the previous number to our current number we have a value that is greater or equal to the same index of our current number in the array clone. If both of those are conditions are met then we can assign that combined value to our array clone.

The second part of the problem is keeping track of the sequence and building it. To keep track of the sequence we want to create an array of the same size as our input array. At each index of the sequence array, we are going to store the index of the previous number in our subsequence.

I know that was a lot to read. Let's take a look at how this translates into code and get a better idea of the solution.

```js
function maximumSumIncreasingSubsequence(array){
    //the sequence array will be used to store
    //the index of the previous number in a sequence
    const sequences = new Array(array.length);

    //the sums array will be used to store
    //the maximum sum at each index in our array
    const sums = array.map(num => num);

    let maxSumIndex = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        const current = array[i];
        //looping through each number before our current number
        for(let j = 0; j < i; j++){
            const previous = array[j];
            //update the maximum sum if the previous number is less
            //than our current number and if sums[j] + the current number
            // is greater than or equal to sums[i]
            //repeat for all numbers before i
            if(previous < current && sums[j] + current >= sums[i]){
                sums[i] = sums[j] + current;
                sequences[i] = j;
            }
        }
        //updating our new maxSumIndex if we found a larger max
        if(sums[i] >= sums[maxSumIndex]) maxSumIndex = i;
    }
    return [sums[maxSumIndex], buildSequence(array, sequences, maxSumIndex)];
}

function buildSequence(array, sequences, current){
    const sequence = [];
    while(current != undefined){
        
        //add the element in the array to the 
        //beginning of the sequence
        sequence.unshift(array[current]);

        //since the sequences array contains the index
        //of the previous number in the sequence
        //if we call the sequence array with our current number
        //we will get the previous number
        current = sequences[current];
    }
    return sequence;
}

```
